This provides the facility to add new members to the data in the Senayan system. Members' information included are: 
- Member ID (ID -barcode/RFID for the member), 
- Member Name (Full Name of the member), 
- Register Date (date horizontal), 
- Expiry Date (the expiration date), 
- Institution (name of institution, agency or organization name ), 
- Membership type (type of membership), 
- Gender (gender), E-mail, 
- Address (home or work address), 
- Postal Code (zip code), 
- Phone Number (phone number), 
- Fax Number (fax number), 
- Personal ID Number (Personal ID number such as identity card number), 
- Notes (short note), and 
- Upload a photo (photo file of member). 

Expiry date contained in the Auto Set, the intent of this facility, is that if the Auto Sett is checked, the member's expiry date will then be calculated based on Membership Type. However, if unchecked, then the Expiry date can be determined manually, by selecting the date of expiry.

This form also provides the feature Pending Membership. If Pending Membership is checked, then that member will not be able to borrow, although their membership is still active. It can be applied as a sanction against members who break the library rules.
