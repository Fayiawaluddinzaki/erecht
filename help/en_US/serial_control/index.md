### Serial Control
<hr>
The Serial Control Module will run if bibliographic data is subscribed for periodical titles. The information that distinguishes between magazine bibliographic data and other document types is the frequency/time the serial is published. If there is no bibliographic data in a table that indicates the frequency, this functionality will not work.
- Subscription Start: fill in the date the subscription will start to be received at the library.
- Total Exemplar Expected: enter the total number you expect to receive in a period of a subscription. E.g to subscribe for a year on a monthly basis insert 12.
- Period Name: Name the subscription period to provide differentiation between periods. Also give a name to distinguish copy subscription one, a second subscription, and so on.
- Subscription Notes: Insert important or useful notes on the subscription. 
- GMD: if necessary, replace it with the appropriate GMD of the item to be subscribed
