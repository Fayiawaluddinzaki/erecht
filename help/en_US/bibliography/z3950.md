#### Z39.50 Service
<hr>
This is a new feature allows library users to take Senayan library data from other libraries. By default SLiMS points to the Library of Congress (http://loc.gov), but other sources can be added at will. Librarians simply enter the title, author or ISBN/ISSN, then Senayan will retrieve the data. If there is more than one result, then the librarian is able to select the desired bibliography and save it.

For effective use of Z39.50 it is best to use ISBN/ISSN, because ISBN/ISSN searches will be more accurate.

Here is the list of  [server z39.50](http://irspy.indexdata.com/).
